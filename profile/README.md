## Welcome to Zap.Store!

Zap Store is the creation of mad genius [Franzap](https://njump.me/npub1wf4pufsucer5va8g9p0rj5dnhvfeh6d8w0g6eayaep5dhps6rsgs43dgh9).

Zap Store is a permissionless app store, which is powered by your friends.

Built on top of [nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) Zap Store allows you to check if your friend Alice follows, recommends, or perhaps has verified a particular app's SHA256 hash. 

Unlike centralized app stores of Guulagl, and Tim Apple, nostr web-of-trust allows for social proof to more closely resemble recommendations of friends & family in real life. There is no more a need to rely solely on a centalized appstore curator. 

Unlike [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium), which is a great solution that allows bypass of appstores, Zap.Store brings the confidence of seeing what apps your contacts interact with. 

### Devs

For devs, you can prove ownership of your APK by cryptographically signing said APK with your nostr, PGP, or other keys. 

In due course, there will be a self-serving, permissionless way to upload your APK to Zap.Store. See https://zap.store/developers, and join the dev chat here: https://t.me/+Azeu1bePFNtkYWMx.

### Bootstrapping & Centralization

On day one, Zap.store will "sign" APK on other devs behalf. Yes this is a centralizing action designed to bootstrap Zap Store. Devs can claim and prove ownership by cryptographically signing their app releases.

### Platforms

Android 0.1 is [released](https://github.com/zapstore/zapstore/releases).
Web/desktop soon™️.
